Q: what is difference between pub/sub and XADD/XREAD/XDEL?
A: Pub/Sub and XADD/XREAD/XDEL are two different features of Redis that serve different purposes.

Pub/Sub is short for "publish/subscribe". It is a messaging paradigm that allows one-to-many communication, where a message publisher sends messages to one or more subscribers who are interested in receiving the messages. In Redis, Pub/Sub is implemented using channels, where messages are published to a channel and all subscribed clients receive the messages on that channel.

On the other hand, XADD/XREAD/XDEL are commands that provide a way to store, read, and delete streams of data in Redis. They are part of the Redis Streams data structure, which is similar to a log file or a message queue.

XADD is used to append data to a stream. It creates a new entry in the stream with a unique ID and the data provided.

XREAD is used to read data from one or more streams. It allows the client to read new entries in real-time or to read entries from a specific point in time.

XDEL is used to delete entries from a stream.

While Pub/Sub and Streams can both be used for messaging and real-time data processing, they have different use cases. Pub/Sub is more suitable for real-time messaging and notification systems, where a message publisher broadcasts messages to multiple subscribers who are interested in receiving the messages. Streams, on the other hand, are more suitable for handling and processing continuous streams of data, such as logs or events, where data is stored in chronological order and can be read and processed in real-time or at a later time.
